<h4>Setting Formly Autocomplete ID</h4>
<p>
  This demo shows the multiple ways that ID can be set on autocomplete so that the label and autocomplete input are
  connected for accessibility purposes.
</p>
<p>First Name shows how the ID can be dynamically set and still ensure the IDs match between label and input.</p>
<p>Middle Name shows a static ID being set and used by both label and autocomplete input.</p>
<p>Last Name shows the ID being auto-assigned by Formly and used by both label and autocomplete input.</p>
<form [formGroup]="form">
  <formly-form [model]="model" [fields]="fields" [options]="options" (modelChange)="onModelChange()" [form]="form">
  </formly-form>
</form>
