<p>
  To configure file input to render a custom template, provide a
  <code>ng-template</code>, get the reference via ViewChild and pass that template in as a templateOption.template in
  <code>ngAfterViewInit</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The teplate being built can expect to receive:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The contents of fieldArray in fields</li>
  <li>The form variable of the file-input</li>
  <li>The model of the file-input</li>
  <li>An eventEmitter modelChanges that can be linked to formly's modelChange event</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A note about providing a formly-form as the custom template: Within the file-input formly type, the form that is
  provided to the custom template is also used by file-input component. Passing this form into a second formly-form
  causes validation to be stripped from the AbstractControl, both in the provided template and in the file-input
  component.
</p>
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="submit()">
  <formly-form [fields]="fields" [form]="form" (modelChange)="onModelChange($event)"></formly-form>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<ng-template #replacementTemplate let-fields="fields" let-form="form" let-model="model" let-modelChange="modelChange">
  <p>Custom</p>
  <formly-form [fields]="fields" [form]="form" (modelChange)="onModelChange($event)"></formly-form>
</ng-template>
