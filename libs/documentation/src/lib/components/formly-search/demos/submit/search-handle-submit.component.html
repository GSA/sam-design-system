<p>
  Search has been updated to keep the model up to date with each character entered by a user. As a result,
  <code>(modelChange)</code> can no longer be used to detect that a user has clicked the submit button.
</p>
<p>
  An output <code>(submit)</code> has been added to search which emits when the user clicks submit. The value of the
  event contains the current state of the model when the user clicks submit.
</p>
<p>
  To supply a function which handles the <code>(submit)</code> output, pass a function to the
  <code>submitHandler</code> field in <code>templateOptions</code>
