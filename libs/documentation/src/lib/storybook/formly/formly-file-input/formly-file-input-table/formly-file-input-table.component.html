<p>
  To configure file input to render a table where the uploaded files can be displayed, provide a
  <code>fieldArray</code> field similar to what is provided in this demo. By default, the file-input component will take
  those configurations and render them in a sds-table. If a custom table implementation is desired, see the
  <b>File Input Example with Custom Template</b> example. <code>type</code> field has not effect on the table that is
  rendered in this example, so it has been removed from the configuration.

<p>
  In this example you can see both a size and required validators being applied to the files that are provided. By not
  providing any file and clicking submit, the required validation can be triggered. Uploading any file over 1kB will
  trigger the size validation.

<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="submit()">
  <formly-form [fields]="fields" [form]="form" (modelChange)="onModelChange($event)"></formly-form>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
