<p>
  The default templates provided by <code>SdsReadonlyModule</code> might not be enough to handle some slightly more
  complex requirements. You may also pass in your own custom html template that you would like to be displayed
  while in readonly mode through the <code>readonlyTemplate</code> method in formly field's <code>templateOptions</code>
</p>

<form [formGroup]="form" class="margin-bottom-3">
  <formly-form [model]="model" [fields]="fields" [form]="form"></formly-form>
</form>

<button class="usa-button" (click)="toggleReadonlyMode()">Toggle Readonly Mode</button>
