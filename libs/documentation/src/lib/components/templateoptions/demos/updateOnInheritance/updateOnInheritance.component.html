<p>By default, the updateOn option assigned to a field will be passed to any
  sub-field contained in <code>fieldGroup</code>. In this example, blur is
  assigned to the top field for it's updateOn option. As a result, the input
  fields contained in it's <code>fieldGroup</code> which do not assign their
  own updateOn option will also update on blur. However, by specifying a
  different updateOn choice, a field can be made to update differently than its
  ancestors.</p>
