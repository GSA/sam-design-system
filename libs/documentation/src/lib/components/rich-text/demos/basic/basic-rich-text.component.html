<b>Inputs</b>
<p><code>maxHeight:</code>number <i>(Optional)</i> - Minimum height in rems
  that the editor can be. If text entered by the user expands beyond the bottom
  of the editor, the editor will expand to display all text. This value is
  expected to be an positive integer or zero. The minimum value is 0 which will
  provide enough room for a single paragraph line to appear. The maximum value is
  <b>X</b> which is large enough to allow for 10 lines of h1 text.</p>
<p><code>maxHeight:</code>number <i>(Optional)</i> - Some Text</p>

<p>The rich text editor component can be passed a formControl for use in
  reactive forms. Subscribing to <code>valueChanges</code> allows developers
  to get updates as users change value of the rich text editor. </p>

<sds-rich-text [formControl]="fc"></sds-rich-text>

<p>Rich Text Editor Value: {{fc.value}}</p>
