<p>
  By default, the updateOn option assigned to a field will be passed to any sub-field contained in
  <code>fieldGroup</code>. In this example, blur is assigned to the top field for it's updateOn option. As a result, the
  input fields contained in it's <code>fieldGroup</code> which do not assign their own updateOn option will also update
  on blur. However, by specifying a different updateOn choice, a field can be made to update differently than its
  ancestors.
