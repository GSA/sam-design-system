<p>To configure file input to render a table where the uploaded files can be
  displayed, provide a <code>fieldArray</code> field similar to what is
  provided in this demo. By default, the file-input component will take those
  configurations and render them in a sds-table. If a custom table
  implementation is desired, see the <b>File Input Example with Custom
  Template</b> example. <code>type</code> field has not effect on the table
  that is rendered in this example, so it has been removed from the
  configuration.</p>

<p>
  In this example you can see both a size and required validators being
  applied to the files that are provided. By not providing any file and
  clicking submit, the required validation can be triggered. Uploading any
  file over 1kB will trigger the size validation.

<form [formGroup]=form (ngSubmit)=submit()>
  <formly-form [fields]="fields" [form]="form" (modelChange)="onModelChange($event)"></formly-form>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
