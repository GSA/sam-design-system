<p>
  Pagination component manages the flow of a user through a number of pages of data. This component allows users to
  advance from page to page and alter the number of results per page. With a change in either page or number of results
  per page, an event is emitted which contains the current configuration of the pagination component so that the data
  view can be updated according to that configuration.
