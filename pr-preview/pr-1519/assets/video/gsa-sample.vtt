WEBVTT - This file has cues.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.950
For years, WDOL gov has been the primary
source for accessing wage rates and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.700
fringe benefit standards used in federal
procurement; however, by the summer of 2019

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.640
WDOL.gov will be fully retired and will no longer be accessible at its current web address.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
WDOL.gov and nine other legacy systems
are currently being

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.640
modernized, streamlined, and integrated
into the new beta.SAM.gov.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.740
beta.SAM.gov is the new home for all of the older systems' data and functionality once they are retired.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.400
All of WDOL.gov's data on minimum wage
and fringe benefit requirements

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.600
has been collected and organized under the data set Wage Determinations

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.760
within beta.SAM.gov.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.900
If you are wondering whether you should be using wage determinations,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.720
the primary users are
government awarding officials and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.720
entities providing services or
construction labor to the federal government.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.170
Before we get started, if you look at the
left side of this video you will find

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.590
all the topics that are going to be
covered in this video

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.300
with the top being the first

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.160
and the bottom the last.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.080
As we progress through the topics, you'll notice that the current topic is highlighted in light blue

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.600
and the completed topics will change to a dark gray,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.700
so if you are looking for information on a specific topic just fast forward or rewind the video

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.840
until the topic you are interested in is
highlighted.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.580
Now, let's begin with a quick tour of beta.SAM.gov.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.740
Whether you navigate
here through the redirect from WDOL.gov,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.680
or you navigate here directly,

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.780
this home screen is going to be the central place through which you do everything on beta.SAM.gov.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.220
The central piece of beta.SAM.gov is the search bar, which will allow you to navigate and access

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.900
all of the data and functionality in one convenient
place.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.500
If for some reason the search bar is ever hidden from view,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.120
just click the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen and the search bar will appear.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.660
We'll discuss more later on how to use the search bar to find particular wage determinations,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.060
but for now we'll just note

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.440
that by selecting an option from the drop-down menu connected to the search bar and clicking search

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.440
you can navigate to that particular beta.SAM.gov section

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.780
Next to the magnifying glass icon at the
top of the screen is a small icon

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.520
comprised of three lines called the
"hamburger menu".

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.567
By clicking this icon you will activate a drop-down menu with a few important links that you should know about.

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:58.980
The first is the learning center link.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.860
By clicking the learning center icon you will be navigated to the space within beta.SAM.gov that will serve as

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.100
your primary source of FAQ, contact,
policy, and procedural reference information.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.540
If you have any questions about the site, please first check the Learning Center for information.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.020
In addition to beta.SAM.gov reference material, the Learning Center also contains

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.860
all relevant reference materials and FAQs from each legacy site including WDOL.gov.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.220
By clicking the hamburger menu again,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.640
you will see a link titled workspace, which is the second important section that all users should be familiar with.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.520
Your workspace is the central place where you can manage all of your account settings

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.820
for features like requests, alerts, save searches, roles, and your profile.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.060
Just as a note before we click, the appearance of your workspace will vary based on your user roles

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.234
and whether or not you are logged in,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.220
so your workspace may look slightly
different from the one shown here in the recording.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.980
Here in your workspace you can see one of the options under your profile is "followings".

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.200
We are going to discuss this more in depth later in the "follow / subscribe" section of the video,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.160
but while we're here, we think it's important to note that

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:27.370
your WDOL.gov wage determination subscriptions will not transfer over to beta.SAM.gov automatically.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.660
You will be able to use beta.SAM.gov's "follow" feature to track wage determinations and receive alerts,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.020
but you will have to reselect all of those that you would like to follow.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.780
Service Contract act, or SCA, wage determinations set the minimum wage rates that must be

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.340
followed by all entities providing applicable services on contracts greater than or equal to $2,500 in value.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.420
To locate SCA wage determinations, navigate to beta.SAM.gov

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.700
click the drop down menu connected to the search bar,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.200
and select "Wage Determinations".

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.380
If you know either the ID number or any of the keywords associated with the wage determination

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.680
that you are looking for, enter them in the search bar,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.760
otherwise, leave the field blank.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:23.720
Click search and you'll be taken to the wage determination section of beta.SAM.gov.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.590
To narrow your search to only SCA wage
determination listings,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.480
navigate to the left side of your screen and scroll down until you find "Wage Determination Types",

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.000
and then click the circle next to
service contract act (or SCA).

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.040
Your search results now contain only SCA listings.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.860
It is important to remember that SCA listings are determined by county,

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.880
so you can use the filters on the left to narrow your search.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.640
Another important thing to note about SCA wage determinations is the final number:

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.300
this number is indicative of fringe benefits requirements for employees.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.997
If the SCA wage determination ends in an even number, it means that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.120
the wage determination specifies a minimum average fringe benefit value across all employees as a whole.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.180
If the SCA wage determination ends in an odd number, it means that

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.000
the wage determination specifies a minimum fringe benefit value for each employee individually.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.200
If there is not an active wage determination for a particular category of work in general

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.040
or in your particular locality, you can request the creation of a wage determination

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.220
by clicking the link that says "here", in the center of the light blue box below the search bar.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.680
You will be navigated to complete and submit the Department of Labor's E98 form.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.440
Once completed and submitted the Department of Labor will respond directly to you,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.460
notifying you of the acceptance or denial of your wage determination request.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.140
Davis-Bacon Act, or DBA, wage
determinations set the minimum wage rates

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.340
that entities must pay to workers who are providing labor to the federal government

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.022
involving construction alteration or repair of public buildings or Public Works,

00:07:16.022 --> 00:07:18.366
including painting or decorating.

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:24.200
To locate DBA wage determinations, navigate to beta.SAM.gov,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.180
click the drop down menu connected to the search bar, and select wage determinations.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.660
If you know either the ID number or any keywords associated with the wage determination

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.580
that you are looking for,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.350
enter them into the search bar, otherwise leave the field blank.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.740
Click search and you will be taken to the wage determination section of beta.SAM.gov.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.200
To narrow your search to only DBA
wage determination listings,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.100
navigate to the side of your screen scroll down until you find "Wage Determination Types",

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.277
and click the circle next to "davis-bacon
act".

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.960
Your search results now contain only DBA listings.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.040
It is important to remember that DBA listings are determined by county and type of Labor,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.980
so you can use the filters on the left of the screen to narrow your search

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.860
by first selecting the relevant state, county, and then type of labor from the drop down menu.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.080
If there isn't an active wage determination for a particular category of work in general

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.980
or in your particular locality,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.451
you can request a creation of a
wage determination

00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:35.990
by clicking the link that says "here" in the center of the light blue box below the search bar you

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.240
will be navigated to complete and submit
Department of Labor standard form E98.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.760
Once completed and submitted, the Department of Labor will respond directly to you,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.540
notifying you of the acceptance or denial of your wage determination request.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:00.120
Collective Bargaining Agreements, or CBAs, are used in negotiations for the benefit of several collective interests,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.850
and they usually lay out wage scales working hours, training, health and safety,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.820
overtime, grievance mechanisms, and rightsto participate in workplace or community affairs.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.200
To locate CBA wage determinations, navigate to beta.SAM.gov,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.320
click the drop down menu connected to
the search bar, and select wage determinations.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.360
If you know either the ID number or any keywords associated

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.800
with the wage determination that you are
looking for,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.480
enter them into the search bar, otherwise leave the field blank.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.260
Click search and you will be taken to the wage determination section of beta.SAM.gov.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.020
To narrow your search to only CBA wage determination listings,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.640
navigate to the left side of your screen, scroll down until you find "Wage Determination Types",

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.500
and click the circle next to "Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA)".

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.340
Your search results now contain only CBA listings.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.100
If you need to create a Collective Bargaining Agreement, you must first create an account,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.800
if you have not already done so,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.380
and then log in to beta.SAM.gov using a recognized government email address.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.060
Once you have registered and are logged
in, click the hamburger menu

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.020
and navigate to your workspace.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.180
Scroll down the page and you will find a section called "Collective Bargaining Agreements".

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.940
Click "Create a new CBA" and fill out the form that you are navigated to,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.880
and once you have all of the information input click publish.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.160
If you already have any published CBAs,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.960
you can navigate to your workspace while
logged in

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.640
and scroll down until you find the option "Revise an existing CBA"

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.680
Click this option and enter the number of your CBA

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.760
and you will be taken to a form
where you can revise your CBA.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:38.440
One of the features of WDOL.gov was the
ability to follow a wage determination

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.170
and receive updates on any changes made
to that particular wage determination.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:48.240
Unfortunately, your current WDOL subscriptions will not be transferred to beta.SAM.gov;

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:55.200
however, the subscription process is simple on beta.SAM.gov through a function called "follow".

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.820
In order to use follow, you must be logged in to beta.SAM.gov.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.120
To follow a wage determination,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.840
navigate to the wage determination section of beta.SAM.gov by selecting wage determinations

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.080
from the drop down menu connected to the
search bar and clicking search.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.320
If you know the ID of the wage determination that you need or a relevant keyword you can enter those

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.760
into the search field;

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.040
however, you can still navigate to the wage determination section by leaving the field blank.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.000
Once in the wage determination section of the website, click the wage determination

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.800
for which you'd like to receive updates

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.120
and locate and click the follow button located in the upper right corner of the listing.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.040
You will now receive notifications regarding any updates to that wage determination.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.560
If you need to modify your wage determination followings,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.280
you can click the hamburger menu to the left of the magnifying glass on the top of the screen

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.480
and then select workspace from the menu that appears,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.000
Once in your workspace select followings from the my profile section.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.720
You can then use the options in this table to change the frequency of the updates you receive

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.120
or to unfollow wage determinations that are no longer relevant to you.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.280
To find the DBA crosswalk select wage determinations from the drop-down connected to the center search bar

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.800
and click search.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.960
Towards the top of the screen, below the search bar, there will be a light blue box

00:13:26.986 --> 00:13:29.000
with two links toward the bottom.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.377
Click DBA Crosswalk.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:35.520
The DBA crosswalk lists the new DBA wage determination values

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.440
along with the previous DBA wage determination values.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.000
If you need to verify wage determinations from previous years you can go to the rollover table.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.040
To find DBA Revisions, select wage determinationsfrom the drop down menu connected to the  search bar

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.407
and click search.

00:13:54.407 --> 00:14:00.240
Near the topof the screen below the search bar there will be a light blue box

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.000
with two links toward the bottom.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.280
Select "DBAs to be Revised".

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.480
Wage determinations are revised
on a regular basis and reviewed

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.013
periodically as new data becomes
available.

00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:15.140
The expected date of the next revision is included at the top of the list.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.960
Wage determinations due to be revised are kept here as a separate link

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.760
to keep contracting communities informed about the specific wage determinations

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.200
that will likely be revised soon,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.560
To learn more, make sure to visit beta.SAM.gov, and while you're there,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.220
