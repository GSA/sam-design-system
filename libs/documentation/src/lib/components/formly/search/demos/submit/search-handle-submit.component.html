<p>
  Search has been updated to keep the model up to date with each character entered
by a user. As a result, <code>(modelChange)</code> can no longer be used to
detect that a user has clicked the submit button.
</p>
<p>
  An output <code>(submit)</code> has been added to search which emits when the
  user clicks submit. The value of the event contains the current state of the
  model when the user clicks submit.
</p>
<p>
  To supply a function which handles the <code>(submit)</code> output, pass a
  function to the <code>submitHandler</code> field in <code>templateOptions</code>
</p>

<form [formGroup]="form">
  <formly-form [model]="model" [fields]="fields" [options]="options" [form]="form" (modelChange)="handleOnModelChange($event)"></formly-form>
